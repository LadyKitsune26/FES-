<h1> I can do This, this will be hard work!</h1>
<p> You know you can do this, you are not replaceable, they are foolish to think that you are, you have more skills to offer then either of they would in this field. You are able to accomplish anything, you are useful you are kind, you can be petty. Sometimes the world needs petty I still think. So this will be my petty. I will do this! I will accomplish this! on my own time, with my own efforts. It will be hard, you have a support system with both Alisha, and it would seem with the team at Frontend as well. If you are going to bother, then make sure you bother hard. For now trust your gut.</p> 

<p>This is Day 1.</p>
