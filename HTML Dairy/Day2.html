	<h2><span>1.1 The Start of the Journey.</span></h2>
		<p>Today was hard.</p>
		<p> I know that the hardest parts are alawys the start of something new, but its going to be a long journey. 12 weeks at 4 extra hours a day. I know i can do this, it just seems to daunting today. 
		<p> Today i learned how to attached an image to a doc. Because I am using notepad to make these and improve my general tag name skills i am uncertain how to accomplish images on here without an extensive search of file names, but i have an idea. I wont be utilizing this new skill on here just yet. I am still working on memorizaiton and reptition. 
		<p> You are on the right track and you want to succeed there is no reason why you can't. Accept it will be a bit difficult. 
		<p> Now i am tired and i hope that when my new VR gets here Neko will help me set it up on Popcorn Palace cause I wanna see what is on there. It will be a good test for me to see if i can ignore the need to play in lieu of work, but i need this.</p>
		<p> You got this.</p>
